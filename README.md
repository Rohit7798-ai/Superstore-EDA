# Superstore Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a fictional superstore's sales data. The objective is to identify patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance across regions, categories, and timeframes. Insights derived from this analysis are intended to support data-driven decisions in retail strategy, inventory management, and customer targeting.

- `Order Date`, `Ship Date`: Timeline of transactions and deliveries.
- `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`: Product hierarchy and names.
- `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`: Core sales metrics.
- `Customer Name`, `Region`, `Segment`, `State`: Customer and geographical metadata.
